## Stack :wrench:

* [NodeJS 16.3.0](https://nodejs.org/fr/download/)
* [NPM 7.15.1](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
* [PostgreSQL 12.7](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
* [Sqitch 0.9999](https://sqitch.org/download/)

These tools are required for the app to run. __Please install them beforehand__.

## Install :construction_worker:

__Clone__ the repository locally (for now, the "develop" branch).

```bash
git clone <url de ce repo>
```
Access the *client* folder and __install the dependencies__.


```bash
cd client/ && yarn
```

Once the operation is completed, access the root and __install the npm packages__.


```bash
cd ../ && npm i
```

Finally, __create__ [a PostgreSQL database](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/app-createdb.html) and __deploy__ the Sqitch migrations to it.

```bash
createdb oap
sqitch deploy db:pg:oap
```
Make sure to __configure__ PostgreSQL so createdb and sqitch commands can be executed.

## Importing data :floppy_disk:

Run the following command to import seeding data into your local database :

```bash
psql -d oap -f /server/data/import.sql
```

## Running the app :rocket:

To launch the webpack server and the API server locally, run the following __script__ while at the root of the app:
```bash
npm run dev
```
