## Learning goals

* Backend:
  * Developing a full __CRUD API__
  * Using __Active Record__ models (no ORM)
  * Using a __database versioning__ tool (sqitch)
  * __JWT__-based authentication: creating JWT on login and checking JWT validity on protected resources requests
  * Setting up __Joi validation__ on POST routes
* Developing a frontend using React + Redux :
  * using __Sass variables__
  * setting up __controlled inputs__
  * using effect hook, ref hook, lifecyle methods and conditional views
  * using container components to connect a presentational component with the Redux store
  * combining several reducers
  * setting up __Redux middleware__ for asynchronous API calls
  * using action creators
  * Adding JWT to HTTP header before sending requests to protected resources

## Install :construction_worker:

Clone the repository locally.

```bash
git clone <repo_url>
```

Access the *client* folder and install the dependencies.

```bash
cd client/ && yarn
```

Once the operation is completed, access the root and install the npm packages.

```bash
cd ../ && npm i
```

Create a PostgreSQL database and deploy the Sqitch migrations to it.

```bash
createdb wildcamp
sqitch deploy db:pg:<PG_connection_URI>
```

Make sure to configure PostgreSQL so createdb and sqitch commands can be executed.

### Importing data :floppy_disk:

Run the following command to import seeding data into your local database :

```bash
psql -d wildcamp -f /server/data/seeding.sql
```

### Setting environment variables

Copy the the .env.example file (/server/.env.example) to create a .env file with your own variables.

### Running the app :rocket:

This is a monorepo containg both the frontend project (client folder) and the backend project (server folder).
To launch the webpack server and the API server locally, access the server folder and run the following __script__:

```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

To access the API Swagger documentation, go to `http://localhost:5000/api-docs`.
